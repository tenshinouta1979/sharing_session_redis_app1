Overall Design
This system consists of two separate ASP.NET Core Razor Pages applications:

App1 (Parent Application): Runs on https://localhost:A. It serves as the main application where a user logs in. It embeds App2 within an <iframe>. App1 is responsible for user authentication and storing shared session-related data into a Redis distributed cache.

App2 (Embedded Child Application): Runs on https://localhost:B. It is embedded within App1's iframe. App2's role is to receive a session ID from App1, use that ID to fetch shared data from the same Redis distributed cache, and then display that data.

The core idea is to demonstrate secure cross-origin communication and shared state management between two distinct web applications using postMessage for session ID transfer and Redis for shared data persistence.

Critical Points on How Session ID is Transferred to App2
The session ID transfer from App1 to App2 is handled client-side using the window.postMessage() API, which is designed for secure cross-origin communication between windows/frames.

App1's Role: After a successful login, App1's Index.cshtml (the frontend) retrieves the ASP.NET Core session ID (which is also the basis for the Redis key). Once App2's iframe signals it's "ready" (or upon App1's onload), App1 uses postMessage() to send this sessionId to the embedded App2 iframe.

Security: App1 specifies App2's exact origin (https://localhost:B) as the targetOrigin in postMessage() to prevent data leakage to unintended origins.

App2's Role: App2's Index.cshtml (the frontend) has a window.addEventListener('message', ...) that listens for incoming messages.

Security: Crucially, App2 verifies the event.origin of the incoming message against a list of allowedOrigins (which includes https://localhost:7038 for App1 and https://*.scf.usercontent.goog for the Canvas environment). This prevents App2 from processing messages from untrusted sources.

If the origin is trusted and the message type is SESSION_ID, App2 extracts the session ID.

How Session Data Works in Various Cases
Once App2 receives the session ID, it initiates an AJAX call to its own backend to retrieve the actual shared data from Redis.

Successful Login & Data Storage (App1):

Upon successful testuser login, App1 generates an ASP.NET Core session ID.

It then constructs a unique Redis key (App1_Session_App1_SharedData_{sessionId}) and serializes user data (username, login time, source app) into a JSON string.

This JSON string is stored in Redis using _cache.SetStringAsync().

App2 Requesting Data (Frontend to Backend):

App2's frontend, after receiving the sessionId via postMessage, makes a fetch request to its own Razor Page handler (/Index?handler=RetrieveSessionData&sessionId={sessionId}).

App2 Backend Retrieving from Redis:

The OnGetRetrieveSessionData handler in App2/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs receives the sessionId.

It constructs the exact same Redis key (App1_Session_App1_SharedData_{sessionId}) that App1 used to store the data.

It attempts to retrieve the JSON string from Redis using _cache.GetStringAsync().

Data Found:

If jsonSharedData is successfully retrieved and is not empty, it's deserialized into a dictionary.

The SessionData property of the IndexModel is populated, and a JsonResult containing the data is returned to App2's frontend.

App2's frontend then updates its UI to display the received session ID and the parsed session data.

Data Not Found (404):

If _cache.GetStringAsync() returns null (meaning the key doesn't exist in Redis), the else block is executed.

App2's backend returns a NotFound result (HTTP 404) with a status message "Shared session data not found."

App2's frontend catches this non-OK response and displays an appropriate error message.

JSON Parsing Errors (500):

If data is found in Redis but cannot be deserialized (e.g., malformed JSON), a JsonException is caught.

App2's backend returns a 500 status with a message indicating a parsing error.

General Exceptions (500):

Any other unexpected errors during Redis communication or processing are caught by a general Exception handler.

App2's backend returns a 500 status with the exception message.

Things We Have Fixed to Get This Work in Order
We encountered and resolved several issues to achieve the current working state:

"400 Bad Request" on App1 Login:

Problem: The login form submission was failing with a 400 error.

Fix: Added @Html.AntiForgeryToken() to the App1 login form and [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] attribute to the OnPostAsync method in App1/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs to correctly handle anti-forgery tokens.

"App2 Refused to Connect" / Cross-Origin Issues:

Problem: App1 couldn't embed App2, or postMessage was failing due to cross-origin security policies.

Fixes:

Configured CORS policy in App2/Program.cs (AllowSpecificOrigin) to explicitly allow App1's origin (https://localhost:7038) and dynamic Canvas origins (https://*.scf.usercontent.goog).

Ensured iframe src in App1/Pages/Index.cshtml correctly pointed to App2's HTTPS port (https://localhost:7053).

Ensured postMessage target origin in App1/Pages/Index.cshtml correctly specified App2's HTTPS port (https://localhost:7053).

HTTPS Enforcement and Port Mismatches:

Problem: Applications were defaulting to HTTP ports or using incorrect HTTPS ports, leading to connection failures.

Fixes:

Verified launchSettings.json in both App1 and App2 had correct HTTPS applicationUrl entries (https://localhost:A and https://localhost:B respectively).

Instructed to run applications using dotnet run --launch-profile https to explicitly use HTTPS.

Recommended running dotnet dev-certs https --trust to trust the .NET development certificates.

RedisConnectionException: UnableToConnect / SocketException: An established connection was aborted:

Problem: App1 couldn't connect to Redis or the connection was immediately dropped after establishment. This was due to Redis running in WSL.

Fixes:

Identified the WSL IP address (172.18.188.83) and updated ConnectionStrings:RedisConnection in both App1/appsettings.json and App2/appsettings.json to use this IP.

Modified redis.conf in WSL:

Commented out the bind 127.0.0.1 -::1 line to make Redis listen on all interfaces.

Changed protected-mode yes to protected-mode no to allow connections from non-loopback IPs without a password (for development).

"Shared session data not found." (404 Error on App2):

Problem: App1's logs showed it was storing data, but App2 couldn't retrieve it, and redis-cli GET returned (nil).

Fix: Discovered that App1's IDistributedCache was automatically prepending App1_Session_ (from options.InstanceName) to the Redis key. Updated App2/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs to construct the Redis key with this exact prefix (App1_Session_App1_SharedData_{sessionId}) for successful retrieval.

By systematically addressing each of these layers, we've established a fully functional system for sharing session data via Redis between two ASP.NET Core applications embedded in an iframe.
